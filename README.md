# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various **Machine Learning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects. Each project demonstrates a unique aspect of predictive modeling, data preprocessing, statistical exploration, and algorithm implementation.

## Projects

#### 1. [California Housing Prices with Linear Regression](./California_Housing_Prices_with_Linear_Regression)
   - **Description**: A regression analysis of housing prices in California using the classic Linear Regression model.

#### 2. [Gradient Descent on Salaries Dataset](./Gradient_Descent_on_Salaries_dataset)
   - **Description**: Implementation of gradient descent optimization on a dataset to predict salary based on experience.

#### 3. [Clustering_for_Credit_Card_Dataset](./Clustering_for_Credit_Card_Dataset)
   - **Description**: Segmenting credit card users with clustring models based on spending behavior and transaction patterns for personalized insights.
Car_Evaluation_data_with_KNN
#### 4. [Car_Evaluation_data_with_KNN](./Car_Evaluation_data_with_KNN)
   - **Description**: Predicting car acceptability using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Car Evaluation Dataset, which assesses vehicle suitability.

#### 5. [Credit_Card_dataset_with_SVM_variants](./Credit_Card_dataset_with_SVM_variants)
   - **Description**: Classifying credit card status using different variants of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect patterns and anomalies.
